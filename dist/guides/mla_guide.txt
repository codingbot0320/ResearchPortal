MLA is a style guide used primarily in the humanities. This guide helps you format your work correctly.

1.  Formatting: Your paper should be double-spaced with a 1-inch margin on all sides.
2.  In-text Citations: Use the author-page number system, e.g., (Smith 123).
3.  Works Cited Page: This is the list of all sources cited in your paper. It is double-spaced, with a hanging indent, and is arranged alphabetically by the author's last name.
