Navigating Peer Review

Responding to reviewer comments is a vital skill.

1.  Stay Calm: Read the comments carefully and neutrally.
2.  Categorize Feedback: Group comments into major, minor, and editorial.
3.  Create a Response Document: Write a point-by-point response for each comment.
4.  Be Respectful and Thorough: Thank the reviewers for their time. Address every single comment, even if you disagree. Provide a clear justification for any decisions not to make a change.
5.  Revise Your Manuscript: Highlight changes in the document to make them easy for the editor to find.
