Plagiarism Prevention Checklist

1.  Paraphrasing: Have you rephrased the source material in your own words?
2.  Citation: Have you included an in-text citation for every piece of information that is not your original idea?
3.  Direct Quotes: Are all direct quotes enclosed in quotation marks and properly cited?
4.  Reference List: Does every in-text citation have a corresponding entry in your reference list or bibliography?
5.  Self-Plagiarism: Have you properly cited your own previously published work?
